        <h1> Music As A Piece of Art</h1>

            I believe in the art of music.
        </p>
        <p class="first-p">
            Believing in the art of music has made music a big part of me. I started understanding music in elementary school when my music teacher was teaching me about the history of music. 
            One day, he divided the class into groups and asked each group to make different terrible sounds. However, it made sense when we put all the sounds together at different intervals, and we sang to it. 
            This made me understand that music is made from terrible sounds that might not be pleasant to hear.

        <p class="second-p">
            My experience with music has made me see music differently. Retired major Ovieawe was my music professor and a songwriter as well as a senior officer in the military school of music. 
            When he passed, his students in the military band decided to pay their respects by being the band at his burial ceremony. They played all his songs, and it was amazing. 
            This made me believe in the art of music because the soldiers were able to show how they felt about the late retired major Ovieawe.

        <p class="third-p">
            The experiences I had with music have made me believe in the art of music. I was invited to a church program, but I wasn’t feeling God’s presence in the atmosphere until a minister with a violin played some songs, 
            that was when I felt the presence of God in the church. That is another expression of music. Therefore, I believe in the art of music because it can make you express what you feel.

        </div>

        <p class="fourth-p">
            As I grew older, my interests changed. I used to go to concerts and stream live music. Now I don’t have time to livestream or go to musical concerts. Now, I’d prefer to listen to songs on my phone. 
            Because of my love for music, I still enjoy it in any way I can.

        <p class="fifth-p">
            Believing in the art of music made me understand that I don't have to be a good singer to love music. I have had the opportunity to practice singing with great singers and songwriters, but I am still not a very good singer. 
            Now, I listen to and sing songs in the bathroom, it is so relaxing. Listening to music in the bathroom opens my mind to think in a different way to make a better decision.

        <p class="sixth-p">
            The different kinds of songs I listen to put me in different moods, which is why I believe in the art of music. When I am having dull moments, I listen to Afrobeat. 
            I listen to gospel songs, folk, rock, alt-rock, and jazz when I feel tired, overwhelmed, worried, or confused. I have a song for every problem.

        <p class="seventh-p">
            Music can be in any form, music is beautiful. Music is life. To me, music is everything. I have grown to love music more even if I don’t invest much time into music like I used to. 
            Music being part of my life has made me meet different people. Music brings people of different backgrounds, races, and cultures together, this is another reason I believe in the art of music.
