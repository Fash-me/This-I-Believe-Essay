        <h1> Music As A Piece of Art</h1>

            I believe in the art of music.
        </p>
        <p class="first-p">
            Music is the art of arranging sound to create a combination of harmony, melody, rhythm, or other expressive content.
             Music can be created using vocals, musical instruments, or both. This definition is from a source on Google. What is art? 
             I will define art as the means of expressing one’s ideas, thoughts, or experiences through a physical medium. Both words are similar because they have to do with expressions and emotions.

            I believe in the art of music, which has made music a big part of me. I started understanding music when my music teacher in elementary school was teaching the class about the history of music.
             We called him Mr. Odofin. Music classes are one of those classes that is always noisy, and no one pays attention to the teacher. That day, he asked everyone to stand up. 
             He asked some of my classmates to walk and drag their feet on the ground to make a particular rhythm. He asked some to clap in a certain way at different time intervals. 
             He asked others to make a funny sound with their mouth. All these sounds were terrible when he asked us to do each sound separately. However, it made sense when we put it all together, and he sang to it.
              He told us that music is made from terrible sounds. Music can be made from the sounds of birds, trains, spoons, plates, two metals hitting each other, or anything you can think of that makes a sound. 
              He also taught us that these sounds independently can be disturbing to the ears, but if one understands music and puts these sounds in the right way and at different intervals, it will be pleasant to the ears. 
              Mr. Odofin made me see music differently, and I try to enjoy every genre of music even if it is not my style of music.

            Another time I experienced Music in its true form was when I went for a military band rehearsal. Retired major Ovieawe was a music professor and a songwriter. 
            Major Ovieawe had passed on, he was the choir’s patron in the church I worshiped then. He was also a senior officer in the military school of music. 
            His student had to pay their last respect. They decided to be the band in his burial ceremony. The choir needed to rehearse with the military band to make that day a success. 
            When we got there, the soldiers were ready with their different musical instruments. There were only three types of instruments that day. The woodwind instruments, the drums, and our voices. 
            There were all sorts of woodwind instruments, some I hadn’t seen before. When they started, I felt like I was like I was in an opera. It was classic music with tonic solfa notations. 
            The soldiers told stories with trumpets and saxophones. Some of his mentees used these instruments to say his eulogy and everyone understood. They played all his songs, and it was amazing. 
            This made me believe in the art of music because the soldiers were able to show how they felt about the late retired major Ovieawe.

            I have learned that music can change your mood and support your thoughts. 
            I was invited to a church program. The program wasn’t giving me the kind of worship environment I wanted. 
            One of the invited gospel artists who used the violin to sing played some songs, and it was heavenly. 
            Immediately I was in the mood of worship, many people were crying and singing. That is another expression of music.
            Therefore, I believe in the art of music; it can make you express how you feel. My experience with music has made me see music differently.

            As I grew older, my interests changed. I usually go to concerts or stream live music. 
            Now that I am older and more occupied with work and what life throws at me, I don’t have time to follow people’s live streams or go to musical concerts. 
            Thinking about it now is like losing a big part of me. I remember a concert I went to; it was an all-night concert. 
            When I heard about the concert, I thought I wouldn’t be able to stay up all night. Even though the concert ended in a fight and people were running helter-skelter, 
            it was one of the best concerts that year and everyone was talking about it. Now I have been too busy to attend concerts or stream live concerts. I’d prefer to listen to songs I have on my phone.

            I had a bad experience learning how to sing, but I believe in the art of music, and I don’t have to be a good singer to understand music. I have had the opportunity to practice singing with great singers and songwriters. 
            I was in the choir in the church where I worshiped, I would be laughed at or made jest of for singing off-key. This made me not want to sing in front of anyone. If I want to sing, it must be in a group and my voice will be low. 
            Now I only listen to songs, sometimes I sing to the songs I am listening to, but I seldom sing without a song playing. When I listen to and sing to music in the bathroom with my Bluetooth speaker, it is so relaxing.
             When I am confused in deciding, or when I am not sure what to do, or when I did something, and I am not sure if I made the right decisions. I get my answers through the kind of music I listen to and sing to because my mind is relaxed.

            The different kinds of songs I listen to put me in different moods, which is why I believe in the art of music. When I feel that I am in a place, and I am having dull moments, I listen to Afrobeat. This is the style of music most Nigerian music artists sing. 
            Afrobeat put me in a dancing mood. I listen to gospel songs, folk, rock, alt-rock, and jazz when I feel tired, overwhelmed, worried, or confused. When listen to gospel and folk, I pay attention to the lyrics, this is where I get my answers. On my phone, 
            I have a song for every problem. When I am tired or overwhelmed, I listen to jazz, rock, and alt-rock. Here I focus on the sound of the instruments, which enriches my mind and makes me feel relaxed.

        <p class="eighth-p">
            People use music to communicate, and express love and how they feel in general. Some Nigerian musicians use their songs to insult themselves or tell their fans that they are not on good terms with another musical artist. 
            If a musical artist is disagreeing with another musical artist or a celebrity, they will mention what the celebrity did to them in their song and say how they feel about what the celebrity had done or said to them.

            Music can be in any form, music is beautiful. Music is life. To me, music is everything. I have grown to love music more even if I don’t invest much time into music like I used to. Music being part of my life has made me meet different people. 
            Tyson is my teammate in the men's soccer team at CLC and he is a very good friend. The first time I met Tyson, we talked about Afrobeat and the most popular Afrobeat musician in Nigeria. That was how I knew he was a vibe.  Music brings people of different backgrounds, 
            races, and cultures together, this is another reason I believe in the art of music.
