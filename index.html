        <P>This is my "This I Believe Essay". I decided to do my multimodal project in a website form. writing codes, problem-solving, and working with technology are things I enjoy doing.
             I won't be able to make a feedback field because the website won't be live. There won't be any database to receive your feedback. I would appreciate it if you could tell me what you think about this project in class. 
             I would love to listen to your ideas. Thanks.
        </P>

            There are two versions of my essay. I made a short version essay (Remix essay) with 522 words and a long version essay (Original essay) with 1288 words. 
            You can pick which one to start with. On each page, I embeded some of my favorite songs.
